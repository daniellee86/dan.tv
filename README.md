## Features and functionalities include;

- Account and profile creation.

- Video Uploads.

- Commenting and Liking.

- Search functionality; query against both user account names and video descriptions

- Page transitions and micro-interactions. My favourite being the 'heart beat' interaction when a user 'likes' a video.
